/// ðŸ‘Œ A thin layer of a Redux-based state manager on top of RxDart.
///
/// Nomi Modifications:
/// - Implemented Store<T> as a Middleware parameter, so Store.dispatch can be
///   called from Middleware to handle side effects/nested actions.
/// - Deleted the Computation typedef 'cause it's just redundant
/// - Removed the second 'beforeAction' Middleware call for AsyncActions
/// - Removed Store(state) variable assignments in Store.dispatch, saving memory!
/// (I think?)
